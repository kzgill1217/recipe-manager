# recipe-manager
A business solution made using Ionic Framework and PouchDB

## The Solution
I have been bartending for a while now and have discovered a common problem with alot of large chain restaurants. They have no advanced
storage solutions for the management of drink and food recipes. Some examples have over 100 alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks which can
be impossible for bartenders to completely memorize without making mistakes. What I have done is created an Android application that has the
capability of locally storing and searching through recipes.

### The Future
This is a single project in a much larger solution which will have a CouchDB database storing all food and drink recipes, administered with
a Laravel application by the business owner, and distributed to all clients through the syncing cabapilities of CouchDB and PouchDB.
